# Feature Specification: Hashtag Activism App

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-hashtag-activism`
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The Hashtag Activism app is a social activism platform designed to help people support causes online by connecting trending hashtags to actionable resources. At its core, the app provides a to-do list where users can take meaningful actions tied to the social issues they care about—for example, petitions, donation links, or educational resources associated with a specific hashtag. The system must be able to track trending social issue hashtags (e.g., #SayHerName, #ClimateStrike, #BlackLivesMatter), map each one to curated resources, and present these in an accessible, mobile-friendly interface. Mock the data for now but set it up so that data can be pulled in from feeds. The design should be clean but friendly."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user visits the Hashtag Activism app, browses trending social issue hashtags, selects a hashtag of interest, and is presented with a to-do list of actionable resources (e.g., petitions, donation links, educational materials) related to that hashtag. The user can mark actions as completed and explore additional resources. The interface is accessible and mobile-friendly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the app, **When** trending hashtags are displayed, **Then** the user can select a hashtag to view associated actions/resources.
2. **Given** a user is viewing a hashtag's resources, **When** the user wants to mark an action as completed and track their tasks, **Then** the they login or create an account. **When** they are logged in the action is visually updated as done.
3. **Given** a user is browsing, **When** new trending hashtags appear, **Then** the list updates to reflect current trends.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no trending hashtags? App shows a default set. 
- How does the system handle inaccessible or broken resource links?
- What if a user tries to mark an action as completed without being logged in? Login required for tracking
